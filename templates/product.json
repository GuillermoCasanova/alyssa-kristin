            "body": "<p><strong>1 . BICEP: </strong>To measure your bicep, relax your arm by your side and find the widest part of your upper arm, typically halfway between your shoulder and elbow. Wrap the measuring tape around this spot, keeping it snug but not tight, and parallel to the floor.<br/><br/><strong>2. BUST:</strong> Measure around the fullest part of your bust while wearing your chosen bra. Keep the measuring tape parallel to the floor and wrap it around your back, bringing it across the fullest point. Remember, bra size is not the same as bust measurement.<br/><br/><strong>3. RIBCAGE:</strong> Getting your waist measurement right is essential, as it often impacts sizing the most. Your natural waist is the narrowest part of your torso, typically just below your rib cage and about 2 inches above your belly button. To find it, bend to one side to locate the crease, then measure around this area, keeping the tape parallel to the floor and snug against your skin.<strong><br/><br/>4. WAIST:</strong> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud.<br/><br/><strong>5. HIPS:</strong> Stand relaxed and wrap the tape around the widest part of your hips (usually around your bum), keeping it parallel to the floor. This spot is typically about 9 inches below your waist. For the most accurate measurement, wear form-fitting clothing.</p>"
